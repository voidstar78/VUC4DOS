# VUC4DOS
voidstar Utility Collection for (MS/DR/PC) DOS

These are all 8088-compatible (can run on IBM PC 5150).  I haven't tried these
with any DOS older than 3.3.

VOIDSTAR'S UTILITY COLLECTION
-----------------------------
PREPARED  August  12th,  2021

The following are a collection of programs I wrote in the early 1990s.  The 
source code for these programs were destroyed in my first (and only) complete 
hard drive crash that happened around 1995.   Often some files can be recovered
in such a crash, but in this case, it was a total lost.  It hurt, I cried,
but the world didn't end.

I also lost all the config and user data files for my BBS (originally named The
Lost Cities, later renamed to COTU - Center of the Universe).  But by the 
mid-1990s, dial-up internet was becoming available in my area (North Florida),
effectively replacing the need for any single-connection BBS.

All of these utilities were likely written in some version of Turbo Pascal.

To avoid any doubt on the matter: I officially release all of these 
executables to the Public Domain. All the original source code to these 
projects have long been lost.

Before my infamous hard drive crash, I was striving to build up my own software
development shop.  I started with the name High Magic Software, and later
changed to Provident Software (to sound more mature).  These are likely not 
the most recent build of these programs, they were older backups that we 
happened to find in my old closest on 3.5" disks around 2019.  That said, 
some of them may still be useful, but there is no way to easily correct or 
modify any of them with no source code being available.  (the spellings 
errors in CDIR could probably be corrected with a HexEditor though).

Summary of utilities:

PROGRAM         SIZE/DATE   DESCRIPTION

- 2ARJ.EXE          9K/????   Convert ZIP2ARJ  |works by invoking SHELL commands to PKZIP and ARJ
- ADDZIP.EXE        6K/1991   Add ZIP Comment  |works by invoking PKZIP -C, can search wildcards and uses provided file as the comment

- ANSMACRO.EXE      6K/1991   ANSI Macro       |uses ANSI.SYS to define keyboard macros
- MACRO.KEY                                    |support file for ANSMACRO.EXE
- MACRO.LST                                    |support file for ANSMACRO.EXE

- ASK.EXE	         10K/???? * Ask User         |used in scripts to ask a question and then uses ERRORLEVEL to determine the response to the question
- ASKDEMO.BAT                                  |an example of how to use the ASK.EXE errorlevel results

- CARRIER.EXE       6K/1992   Carrier Detect   |examines COM port to see if a carrier is present, returns different ERRORLEVEL if so (requires a FOSSIL.SYS driver)
- CDIR.EXE	       15K/1995 * ColorDIR 3.1b    |use “cdir ?” because “cdir -h” seems to causes lockup
- CDIR30.EXE	     11K/1991   ColorDIR 3.0     |funny “cdir -h”, can run out of memory if there is a large number of files in the folder
- CHATTRIB.EXE	   20K/1991   ChangeAttributes |really just my intro to Pascal and using the OPRO GUI library
- CLOCK.EXE	        9K/1991   Clock In/Out     |writes current time to a specified command line filename, I used it to track my time at my first job
- DELALL.EXE        7K/1991   DeleteAllFiles   |delete all files of a given wildcard; typically I used this to remove extra FILEID.DIZ
- DELSIZE.EXE       7K/1991   DeleteSize       |delete files of a specified byte size; typically I used this to remove 0 byte files
- EDIT.EXE	       31K/1991   TextEditor       |I believe this is a real-mode program and limited to editing files no longer than 64KB	
- FILELIST.EXE     15K/????   Make FileList    |Scan a directoy structure and list all the files in specified output file (e.g. FILELIST.TXT
- MR.EXE	         10K/???? * Memory View	     |shows what is current consuming system memory; I had a newer version that also reported CPU type, was similar to CheckIt
- NUKE.EXE	        7K/1990 * Nuke 1.0	     |nuke all contents of a specified folder and recursively remove all subfolders)  (safe to run with no command line arguments
- PHONE.EXE	       22K/1992   Phone Database   |a later demo of using the OPRO library for a simple database entry system; a later version included the ability to attach and preview TIF images with entries
- QMATH.EXE	        7K/???? * QuickMath        |command line math calculator, like "qmath 5.2+(4.8-3.5)*2"
- REBOOT.EXE	      3K/???? * Reboot the Systme from Command Line
- SEARCH.EXE        6K/???? * Search for File  |wildcards supported, recursively search specified folder; provides summary of total bytes used by all the found files
- TERMINAL.EXE	   11K/1991   (Simple) Terminal|my first attempt at a simple terminal connection program, and included Zmodem support
- TEXTATTR.EXE	    4K/1990 * Show all IBM PC text attributes|help remind what code is what effect
- TIMEIS.EXE        5K/????   What Time Is It  |writes the current time and date to DOS screen in plain-text, but this output cannot be pipped to a file
- TSAR.EXE	        7K/1992   Text Search and Replace|scan a text file and replace content based on command line arguments
- XMIT.EXE	        5K/????   Xmit Time        |estimates file transfer times using command line arguments

"*" Entries that I consider to be the most useful utilities.
